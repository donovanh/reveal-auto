# Reveal.js auto slide template

Based on the amazing [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), this is a super-simple 20 slide presentation template, set to automatically move to the next slide every 15 seconds.

To run, open the index.html file in a web browser. It doesn't use any of the advanced features of Reveal so won't need to run on it's own server.

When it reaches the last slide, press the "play" button on the bottom left to restart. Best of luck!
